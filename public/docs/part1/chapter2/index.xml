      <description>Summary#Hugo is available for installation in most major package managers on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Hugo has extensive command-line functionality to minimize the work that its users need to do. It has handy options that help build all parts of a website, from adding module dependencies to creating new Markdown-based documents.
A Hugo project consists of folders beyond the content and themes folders: static for static content, data for structured data, layouts for theme overrides, resources for Hugoâ€™s internal caching, assets for images, JavaScript, and CSS files, and public for the generated output.</description>
