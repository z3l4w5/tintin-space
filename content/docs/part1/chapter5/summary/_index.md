# Summary

The Go template language has full support for variables, functions, conditionals, and loops.

We can use variables to access the site and page metadata, including information like menus and all the pages in the website.

Hugo can get structured metadata from the front matter as well as from files on disk. Structured data allows for easier use of individual values as variables.

We can use the Go template language in shortcodes programmatically to create new features for Markdown.

Archetypes are templates to the content files that can be used to prepopulate specific front matter fields, create the correct folder structure, and provide placeholders for content creators.
