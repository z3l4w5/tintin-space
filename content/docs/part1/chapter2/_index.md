Hugo is quick and easy to get started with. You can download Hugo and get going using just a basic text editor and a web browser. This chapter navigates through the entire length of Jamstack’s flow as figure 2.1 illustrates. We will create a website for a company named Acme Corporation. Acme Corporation is a leading manufac- turer of shapes like lines, circles, squares, and triangles in digital form. We will use the Hugo command line to bootstrap the website (section 2.1) with a prebuilt theme (section 2.2) and some ready-to-use content (section 2.3). We will also host the website on the internet (section 2.4) and analyze the decisions made in this
chapter for performance and maintainability (section 2.5). Note that we will enhance this website throughout the book.
