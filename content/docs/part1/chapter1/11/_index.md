# 1.11 How to be successful with Hugo and this book

In this book, we will build the website for Acme Corporation, a leading manufacturer  of digital shapes. The website will have regular company pages, a blog with support for dynamic comments and searches, a JavaScript-based shape editor, and a storefront to
purchase your shapes delivered over email. The final version of the website that we will build in this book is hosted at https://chapter-13-09.hugoinaction.com/.

We will start with the markup layer of the Jamstack, which Hugo excels in. We will talk about creating and organizing markup-based documents in a Hugo website, how to use those to render web pages, creating themes that share the web templates, and how to use modules to create reusable content and template code. In the second part of the book, we will delve into Hugoâ€™s support for the JavaScript and API portions of the Jamstack. We will see how to call APIs at compile time and run time, build simple Jamstack-based APIs, and use JavaScript to enhance the user experience. We will also compile and bundle a complex JavaScript application with a Hugo-based website.

To succeed with this book, you need a machine with a modern operating system, access to the internet, a web browser, and an understanding of tools and program- ming languages familiar to a web developer. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, any template engine such as Mustache, Jade, or Embedded Ruby (ERB), and optionally npm. The code samples are all available on GitHub and hosted at https://hugoinaction.com. We recommended using the diff between the various files to compare the changes done locally to those present in the code samples.
